# What
A centralized "reference" for the music I've made over time.
# Audience
The repository is intended to be viewed mostly by people I already know. It is public
so that I can share my pieces through a single link rather than using mail or other
complicated methods.
# Why the various formats
I have a channel where I share my music as videos each week. Not all of my music has been shared
there yet and so I haven't made all of it into videos.
# Legal note
Some of the soundfonts that I use in my compositions require attribution. I'm not yet sure whether
I'm required to communicate that for each song on its own but (as of Nov 27 2021) I believe I only
need to give attriution to the Touhou soundfont (https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/433). All
other soundfonts (SGM, GeneralUser GS, Fluid (R3) GM, choriumreva, etc.) are free for use AFAIK.
